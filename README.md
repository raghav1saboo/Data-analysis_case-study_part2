## Introduction
Welcome to the "Data Analysis Case Study Part 2" repository. This project is a continuation of Part 1 and involves further data analysis and exploration of the dataset from a real-world scenario. The goal is to build upon the insights gained in Part 1 and perform more advanced analysis to derive meaningful conclusions.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this project include:
- Extending the analysis from Part 1 by incorporating additional data and metrics.
- Applying advanced data manipulation and statistical techniques to gain deeper insights.
- Creating visualizations and reports to effectively communicate the findings.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- Scikit-learn
